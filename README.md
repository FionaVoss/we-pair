# What is this?

A list of companies that pair program, for job seekers.

# Why?

The goal of this list is to be a comprehensive resource for engineers around the world who want to find jobs where they can pair program. These companies may or may not be hiring right now, but if you love pairing, you can start your job search here.

Inspired by https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application and https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards.
